### **Tips for Using Coin Master Spins Effectively**

Once you have your **free spins** (whether itâ€™s 70 spins, 100 spins, or more), itâ€™s essential to use them wisely. Here are some top strategies for making the most out of your spins:

1. **Maximize Raids and Attacks:**
   The goal of the game is to earn as many coins as possible to upgrade your village. Use your spins for **raids** and **attacks**, as these activities can yield a lot of coins. By using spins for these actions, you will progress faster and earn more rewards in the game.

2. **Time Your Spins:**
   Be strategic about when you use your spins. Avoid wasting spins when your inventory is full or when you donâ€™t need the resources. Instead, wait for events that give extra rewards for specific actions (like raids or attacks).

3. **Upgrade Your Village:**
   As you accumulate spins and coins, youâ€™ll need to use those resources to upgrade your village. Prioritize upgrading the items that will unlock more opportunities for spins, like the **casino** or other key structures.

4. **Donâ€™t Waste Spins on Pets:**
   Pets in Coin Master are essential, but they donâ€™t necessarily provide the highest return on your spins. Focus on using your spins for high-reward actions like raids or attacks to progress faster.
